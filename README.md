# Doodle Tarot Reader

Welcome to **Doodle Tarot Reader**, an online tarot reading experience where your creativity shapes your fate! Hosted on GitHub Pages, this interactive web app lets you draw a doodle to generate a personalized tarot reading, bypassing the limits of computer-generated randomness with your unique artwork.

## Concept

Traditional tarot relies on shuffled cards, but computers struggle to produce truly random results. **Doodle Tarot Reader** solves this by using *your doodle* as the seed for randomness. Each sketch you make on the canvas influences the cards drawn, ensuring a one-of-a-kind reading every time. Choose a theme—Love, Career, or General—and watch your doodle reveal insights through the tarot’s wisdom.
